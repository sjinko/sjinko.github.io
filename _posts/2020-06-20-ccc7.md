This week-end, took place the last session of the Citizen Convention on Climate. As scientific observers, my colleagues at Ch√¥ros and I followed the entire process of the Convention. On Sunday, the citizens members of the Convention voted in favor of the final version of the report that will propulse France in the ecological, social and economical transition.
