Artificial intelligence (AI) technology takes different forms in different social, cultural and geographical contexts. For example, AI impacts differently people according to their location, age, gender and revenue. AI also provides many solutions for sustainable development in emergent economies. Face with this two-side nature of AI technology, this second edition of AI & Cities focused on sustainability, trust and citizenship. Again, it gathers scholars, companies and city officials from all around the world to present research and innovation project using or questioning AI technology.
