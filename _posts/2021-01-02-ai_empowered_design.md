The idea that artificial intelligence will replace designer is ludicrous. Such technology presents, however, many risks to the practice of design. Algorithmic bias can have detrimental effects if set in stone by architects, urban planners and designers. Many design schools remain reluctant to engage with AI technology and know-how. But AI can also prove to be an opportunity for environmental design practices. For example, when use as means to generate innovative artefacts that leverage the design process. By supporting creativity and critical understanding of inequalities, AI could also attract more attention to the role of design in society. By empowering design and designers, AI might provide a powerful tool to formalize ethical and aesthetic innovation for future generations.
