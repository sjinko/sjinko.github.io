Public spaces in cities are the locus of many social and commercial practices and must be carefully planned for future generations. The quality of public space contributes greatly to the quality of life and the economy of cities. In Lausanne, the City wants to improve these qualities, but first must understand how its people use public space. From the impulse of the City’s Service des Espaces Publics, and in collaboration with Gehl Architects, we took part in an analysis of the “public spaces and the public life” of the central area of Lausanne. Results of the research, which will be published in September 2020, highlight how Lausanne could take advantage of its topography to increase the quality of its public space system.
