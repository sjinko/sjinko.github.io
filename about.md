## Planning the Digital City through Aspirations
I am a spatial planner with a background in design, social studies and data science. 

My work aims at fostering societal sustainability by bridging urban data science and digital governance.

As the Scientific Coordinator of the dhCenter UNIL-EPFL, I develop research projects and graduate courses on the application of digital and computational methods in social sciences and the humanities. In collaboration with faculty at EPFL and the University of Lausanne, I plan the future of digital studies, digital humanities and the computational social science across both universities.

At EPFL Habitat Research Center, I conduct research in the field of digital urban planning and city science. My projects result from collaborations with national and sub-national government agencies, and para-public and private companies.

Since 2016, I am a Co-Founder and Research Associate at Chôros, an international scientific think tank for spatial justice and planning based in Paris.

My recent collaborations include the French Ministry of National Education and Youth; the French Ministry of Agriculture; the French Postal Service; the Economic, Social and Environmental Council of France; the French National Commission for Public Debate; the  the Jean-Jaurès Foundation; the Braillard Architects Foundation; and the City of Lausanne.

In my free time, I develop a general theory of urbanism linking urban design, spatial planning and political polarization.

## Experience

Prior to my current position, I conducted research at ETH Zurich, MIT Media Lab, the University of Oxford, the National University of Singapore, ETH Singapore and EPFL, and was appointed Visiting Professor at the University of Montreal.
