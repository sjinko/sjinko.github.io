      		<h3>Data Empowerment in Ecological Participatory Democratic Governance</h3>
      		<p><p>Participatory democracy offers a novel avenue for planning a more sustainable and just territory. By empowering citizens, these processes allow for a greater reflexivity and a greater legitimacy than traditional politics. “Data Empowerment in Ecological Participatory Democratic Governance Events (Deep Edge) is a research-action project, which aims to transport citizen aspirations to planning practices through open digital tools.</p>

<p>Deep Edge follows two national events of participatory democracy in France whose mission is to define applicable measure to make France more sustainable and more just: the “Convention citoyenne pour le climat,” and the “Débat national sur la Politique agricole commune.” These experiences highlight the importance of multimodal spatial data and their visualization in participatory democracy.</p>

<p>Moreover, in the context of the 2020 sanitary crisis, the events illustrate the central role that multimedia platform can have in creating an interface between members assemblies, governance committees, researchers and the civil society. Digital tools do not simply serve an organizational purpose but become an integral part of the democratic process and transition towards social, economic and ecological sustainability.</p>

      		<h3>Public Space Public Life Lausanne</h3>
      		<p><p>Public spaces in cities are the locus of many social and commercial practices and must be carefully planned for future generations. The quality of public space contributes greatly to the quality of life and the economy of cities. In Lausanne, the City wants to improve these qualities, but first must understand how its people use public space. From the impulse of the City’s Service des Espaces Publics, and in collaboration with Gehl Architects, we took part in an analysis of the “public spaces and the public life” of the central area of Lausanne. Results of the research, which will be published in September 2020, highlight how Lausanne could take advantage of its topography to increase the quality of its public space system.</p>

      		<h3>Spaces for Educational Success</h3>
      		<p><p>Educational buildings and mobility emit large share of green gas in France. Their governance therefore offers an important lever to the State in order engage in a sustainable transition of the territory. But how can one balance the planning of educational infrastructure and the individual aspirations of fifteen million students?</p>

<p>During its first year of existence, the research project “Espaces pour l’école de la réussite” (EPER) focused on the methodological foundations for a sustainable planning of educational infrastructure that would be compatible with the academic aspirations and capabilities of students.</p>

<p>To this end, we combined the data analysis of six million middle—and high school students currently registered in Metropolitan France, and semi-directive interviews of students and parents in the Grand Est region.</p>

<p>Our results showed that the distance between home and schools did not have a significative effect on students’ grades, but that their academic and professional aspirations remained strongly bonded to the type of urban context in which they lived and studied.</p>

<p>In confronting these two realities, EPER offers some ground for the planning of a more sustainable territory in a better-educated society.</p>
