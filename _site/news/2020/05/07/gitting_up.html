	<h1>Gitting up!</h1>
	<p>07 May 2020 - GitHub</p>
	<div class="content">
		<p>When it comes to setting up a new website, I decided to go with <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Page</a>, a service extension native to the version controlling system. Thanks to GitHub, I can run my website directly from a repository, and pull/push all the content from my local machine. Passing to GitHub Pages is also a great way to increase my understanding of how open tools can contribute to make a more sustainable society. Have a look at GitHub Pages today, and train your digital literacy in a fun and productive way!</p>

<p>PS. No, I donâ€™t have any financial interest in GitHub, I am just being enthusiastic.</p>
