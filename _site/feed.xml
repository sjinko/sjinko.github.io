Lifestyles associated with urbanization patterns are strongly bound to political preferences. Recent elections and votes in Europe and North America suggest an increasing polarization of voters. Since the mid-eighties, large social movements and protests for social equality, justice and the environment have increasingly departed from cities. Analyzing thirty years of national referendum in Switzerland, these maps show new levels and dynamics of political polarization in the country. Long-standing divide between linguistic and religious groups reduce vis-à-vis an emergent disagreement between larger cities’ inhabitants and linguistic minorities, on the one hand, and culturally dominant suburbs and countryside, on the other hand. These results illustrate a renewed political alliance between urbanites and cultural minorities on social, economic and environmental issues, which resonate with recent protests around the world. Centered on the values of voting populations, these maps propose new models to understand the effects of urban and territorial planning on social processes and politics, and open to a series of design and planning strategies to reduce social and political conflicts at the regional and national level.&lt;/p&gt;

Organizing a good challenge requires, however, a lot of conceptual and technical efforts, coordination and understanding of data and visualization.

&lt;p&gt;DaVinci takes a step in that direction and provides an open digital infrastructure to organize and publish data visualization challenges. DaVinci includes functionalities to launch the call for data visualization projects, communicate with project owners, attribute single object identifiers to each project, redirect information towards owners contact information and online presence, and display projects in an interactive interface. Additionally, DaVinci performs basic local analyses of data visualization projects on dominant colors, dominant shapes, themes, format, etc. Scalable and inter-operable in nature, DaVinci makes the organization of data visualization challenge easy, and opens to new ways of communicating, presenting and teaching about scientific knowledge and skills.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Shin Alexandre Koseki</name></author><category term="Project" /><category term="data visualization" /><category term="digital pipeline" /><category term="dataviz" /><category term="challenge" /><category term="open source" /><category term="data infrastructure" /><category term="scalability" /><category term="schools" /><category term="teaching" /><category term="learning" /><category term="data literacy" /><category term="digital support" /><category term="digital scholarship" /><summary type="html">Data visualization is a powerful way to valorize scientific outputs and establish collaborative dialogue with the public.
