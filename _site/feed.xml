Depending on how and who makes them, AI systems can lead to more bias and discrimination. In order to mitigate this risk, international standards make technology more transparent and accountable to the public. They also help raise awareness of the authorities on the importance to develop sustainable socio-technical systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, our group of experts on digitization, ethics and society discussed actionable actions to define such international standard for the governance of AI systems. We shared insights on participatory approach, data ethics, cross-cultural values and aspirations. We want to depart from people, their views, their understanding and their values. We want to know who, they think, should develop AI systems and how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting marked the first session of The Trust Chronicles, a IEEE initiative on the ethics of AI systems. The Trust Chronicles should define an international standard for the governance of AI systems’ sustainable development and application.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Shin Alexandre Koseki</name></author><category term="News" /><category term="AI" /><category term="Artificial intelligence" /><category term="Trust" /><category term="IEEE" /><category term="Ethics" /><category term="Committee" /><category term="Digital Humanities" /><category term="Data Studies" /><category term="Data Science" /><category term="Participatory Design" /><category term="Policy-Making" /><category term="Standards" /><category term="Digitization" /><category term="Cross-cultural values" /><category term="Innovation" /><summary type="html">As artificial intelligence systems become omnipresent, we must make sure that the technology is trustworthy.

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to GitHub, I can run my website directly from a repository, and pull/push all the content from my local machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passing to GitHub Pages is also a great way to increase my understanding of how open tools can contribute to make a more sustainable society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a look at GitHub Pages today, and train your digital literacy in a fun and productive way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS. No, I don’t have any financial interest in GitHub, I am just being enthusiastic.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Shin</name></author><category term="News" /><category term="GitHub" /><category term="Website" /><category term="shinkoseki.com" /><category term="sjinko" /><summary type="html">When it comes to setting up a new website, I decided to go with GitHub Page, a service extension native to the version controlling system.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">We welcome David Grahame Shane, virtually</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/event/2020/05/06/we_welcome_david_grahame_shane.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="We welcome David Grahame Shane, virtually" /><published>2020-05-06T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2020-05-06T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/event/2020/05/06/we_welcome_david_grahame_shane</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/event/2020/05/06/we_welcome_david_grahame_shane.html">&lt;p&gt;While the anti-COVID-19 measures have put a stain on many events, they also fostered impromptu visits from distinguished guests.

&lt;p&gt;From his home, Professor Grahame Shane provided insightful feedback to the lab’s PhD researchers about their works. The meeting was the occasion to reconnect with an old friend of the lab and remind us of his latest visit few years ago, in propria persona.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Event" /><category term="EPFL" /><category term="Lab-U" /><category term="Urbanism" /><category term="Columbia University" /><category term="Visit" /><category term="Covid-19" /><category term="Zoom" /><category term="Social Distancing" /><summary type="html">While the anti-COVID-19 measures have put a stain on many events, they also fostered impromptu visits from distinguished guests.
