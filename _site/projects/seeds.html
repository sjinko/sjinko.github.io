		<p>Educational buildings and mobility emit large share of green gas in France. Their governance therefore offers an important lever to the State in order engage in a sustainable transition of the territory. But how can one balance the planning of educational infrastructure and the individual aspirations of fifteen million students?</p>

<p>During its first year of existence, the research project “Espaces pour l’école de la réussite” (EPER) focused on the methodological foundations for a sustainable planning of educational infrastructure that would be compatible with the academic aspirations and capabilities of students.</p>

<p>To this end, we combined the data analysis of six million middle—and high school students currently registered in Metropolitan France, and semi-directive interviews of students and parents in the Grand Est region.</p>

<p>Our results showed that the distance between home and schools did not have a significative effect on students’ grades, but that their academic and professional aspirations remained strongly bonded to the type of urban context in which they lived and studied.</p>

<p>In confronting these two realities, EPER offers some ground for the planning of a more sustainable territory in a better-educated society.</p>
