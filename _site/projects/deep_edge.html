	<h2>Data Empowerment in Ecological Participatory Democratic Governance</h2>
</div>

<p>Participatory democracy offers a novel avenue for planning a more sustainable and just territory. By empowering citizens, these processes allow for a greater reflexivity and a greater legitimacy than traditional politics. “Data Empowerment in Ecological Participatory Democratic Governance Events (Deep Edge) is a research-action project, which aims to transport citizen aspirations to planning practices through open digital tools.</p>

<p>Deep Edge follows two national events of participatory democracy in France whose mission is to define applicable measure to make France more sustainable and more just: the “Convention citoyenne pour le climat,” and the “Débat national sur la Politique agricole commune.” These experiences highlight the importance of multimodal spatial data and their visualization in participatory democracy.</p>

<p>Moreover, in the context of the 2020 sanitary crisis, the events illustrate the central role that multimedia platform can have in creating an interface between members assemblies, governance committees, researchers and the civil society. Digital tools do not simply serve an organizational purpose but become an integral part of the democratic process and transition towards social, economic and ecological sustainability.</p>
