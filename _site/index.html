				<h2><a href="/project/2020/05/12/davinci.html">Initiating 'DaVinci', a dataViz challenge inceptor</a></h2> 
				<p>Data visualization is a powerful way to valorize scientific outputs and establish collaborative dialogue with the public. Data visualization challenges are increasingly popular within organizations, companies, and schools where they provide an effective way to teach learners of all age about creativity, digital literacy, project management and science. Organizing a good challenge requires, however, a lot of conceptual and technical efforts, coordination and understanding of data and visualization. To this end, so-called “visualization pipelines” offers a support to develop data visualization projects. This digital infrastructure does not, however, provide cues and clues to invite, gather, combine, display and diffuse various data visualization projects.</p>

				<p>As artificial intelligence systems become omnipresent, we must make sure that the technology is trustworthy. Depending on how and who makes them, AI systems can lead to more bias and discrimination. In order to mitigate this risk, international standards make technology more transparent and accountable to the public. They also help raise awareness of the authorities on the importance to develop sustainable socio-technical systems.</p>

				<p>The current pandemic highlights our lack of tools to deal with uncertain situations at a global scale. Risks of recession and political upheavals illustrate how badly humans were prepared for the rapid sprawl of the disease. In order to govern this uncertainty, we propose two approaches, which our group has contributed to over the years: citizen science and interactive democracy. Together, these approach open up to a greater reflexivity and preparedness to face uncertain condition and build a more resilient global society.</p>

				<p>When it comes to setting up a new website, I decided to go with <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Page</a>, a service extension native to the version controlling system. Thanks to GitHub, I can run my website directly from a repository, and pull/push all the content from my local machine. Passing to GitHub Pages is also a great way to increase my understanding of how open tools can contribute to make a more sustainable society. Have a look at GitHub Pages today, and train your digital literacy in a fun and productive way!</p>

				<p>While the anti-COVID-19 measures have put a stain on many events, they also fostered impromptu visits from distinguished guests. Virtually at least. Today, we welcomed <a href="https://www.arch.columbia.edu/faculty/329-david-grahame-shane">David Grahame Shane</a>, professor at Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation of the Columbia University in the City New York. From his home, Professor Grahame Shane provided insightful feedback to the lab’s PhD researchers about their works. The meeting was the occasion to reconnect with an old friend of the lab and remind us of his latest visit few years ago, in propria persona.</p>

				<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) technology takes different forms in different social, cultural and geographical contexts. For example, AI impacts differently people according to their location, age, gender and revenue. AI also provides many solutions for sustainable development in emergent economies. Face with this two-side nature of AI technology, this second edition of AI &amp; Cities focused on sustainability, trust and citizenship. Again, it gathers scholars, companies and city officials from all around the world to present research and innovation project using or questioning AI technology.</p>

				<h2><a href="/event/2019/01/28/ai_and_cities.html">AI & Cities. Risks and Opportunities for Business, Governance and Society</a></h2> 
				<p>Applications of artificial intelligence systems (AI) in urban contexts are increasing at an exponential rate. As any technology, AI offers much potential and poses certain risks, which planners and city officials must consider. Face detection, movement tracking, image analysis are examples of applied machine and deep learning technology that can both improve urban sustainability and be a threat to personal information. AI &amp; Cities was a track at the Applied Machine Learning Days, which mission was to showcase the variety of approach and critics on the development and application of AI in urban contexts. Speakers from all around the word shared views, hopes and concerns in a half-day panel that brought together researchers, urban planners, politicians and activists.</p>

				<p>Digitization has an increasing impact on society and research. Digital tools and concerns create their own scientific ecosystem. Given the strategic importance of digitization for social economic development, national science funds provide growing share of their funding to projects concerned with digitization. In order to get a sense of the current research ecosystem on digitization, Digital Future Network Day gathered over sixty Swiss researchers, delegates of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), and member of the EPFL research community to discuss the future directions of scientific in digital and computational research. The event marked the launch of the call for the SNSF National Research Project 77: Digital Transformation.</p>
