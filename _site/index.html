				<h2><a href="/invited%20lecture/2020/06/25/democracy_and_spatial_design_conference.html">Spatial Design & Democracy. Mapping the Intersection of Values in Urban Space</a></h2> 
				<p>The effect of spatial design and planning on dynamics of political polarization remains largely unknown, at the risk of fostering social and economic upheavals. Lifestyles associated with urbanization patterns are strongly bound to political preferences. Recent elections and votes in Europe and North America suggest an increasing polarization of voters. Since the mid-eighties, large social movements and protests for social equality, justice and the environment have increasingly departed from cities. Analyzing thirty years of national referendum in Switzerland, these maps show new levels and dynamics of political polarization in the country. Long-standing divide between linguistic and religious groups reduce vis-à-vis an emergent disagreement between larger cities’ inhabitants and linguistic minorities, on the one hand, and culturally dominant suburbs and countryside, on the other hand. These results illustrate a renewed political alliance between urbanites and cultural minorities on social, economic and environmental issues, which resonate with recent protests around the world. Centered on the values of voting populations, these maps propose new models to understand the effects of urban and territorial planning on social processes and politics, and open to a series of design and planning strategies to reduce social and political conflicts at the regional and national level.</p>

				<h2><a href="/workshop/2020/06/11/data_fairsharing.html">To improve spatial quality and sustainabilty, we create digital standards</a></h2> 
				<p>References to public space lack of international identification standards that would increase their quality and sustainability. In many fields, identification standards provide efficient and permanent protocols to describe objects, events and locations. These combine tools such as unique identifiers, data ontologies and format specifications. Following the “Data FAIR principles,” the tools can easily be integrated to a permanent and publicly accessible digital infrastructure. Here, we propose to establish a data standard for public space that would facilitate transdisciplinary collaboration and citizen participation to the design and planning process. The resulting standard follows “FAIR data principles” and subscribe to <em>Data FairSharing</em> platform. It provides a canvas to make public space data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable for practitioners and researchers, increasing the possibility for building better public space based on citizens’ aspirations.</p>

				<p>Communication and dissemination remain difficult when working at the intersection of urban planning and research. This effort is, however, necessary if we want to create better public space for people. In Europe, such task is supported by the COST Action 18204 “Dynamics of Placemaking and Digitization in the European City” which gathers urban planning practitioners and researchers from over thirty countries. As a representative for Switzerland, I actively took part in the first workshop on the action’s communication and dissemination strategy. Thanks to the support of Kenneth Bone, our communication officer, we were able to discuss the central role of new media in transdisciplinary collaboration, and their indirect contribution to making better public space.</p>

				<p>Data visualization is a powerful way to valorize scientific outputs and establish collaborative dialogue with the public. Data visualization challenges are increasingly popular within organizations, companies, and schools where they provide an effective way to teach learners of all age about creativity, digital literacy, project management and science. Organizing a good challenge requires, however, a lot of conceptual and technical efforts, coordination and understanding of data and visualization. To this end, so-called “visualization pipelines” offers a support to develop data visualization projects. This digital infrastructure does not, however, provide cues and clues to invite, gather, combine, display and diffuse various data visualization projects.</p>

				<h2><a href="/news/2020/05/08/trusting_ai_systems.html">AI Trust at IEEE</a></h2> 
				<p>As artificial intelligence systems become omnipresent, we must make sure that the technology is trustworthy. Depending on how and who makes them, AI systems can lead to more bias and discrimination. In order to mitigate this risk, international standards make technology more transparent and accountable to the public. They also help raise awareness of the authorities on the importance to develop sustainable socio-technical systems. Today, our group of experts on digitization, ethics and society discussed actionable actions to define such international standard for the governance of AI systems. We shared insights on participatory approach, data ethics, cross-cultural values and aspirations. We want to depart from people, their views, their understanding and their values. We want to know who, they think, should develop AI systems and how. The meeting marked the first session of <em>AI Synergy Committe</em>, a IEEE initiative on the ethics of AI systems. The Trust Chronicles should define an international standard for the governance of AI systems’ sustainable development and application.</p>

				<p>The current pandemic highlights our lack of tools to deal with uncertain situations at a global scale. Risks of recession and political upheavals illustrate how badly humans were prepared for the rapid sprawl of the disease. In order to govern this uncertainty, we propose two approaches, which our group has contributed to over the years: citizen science and interactive democracy. Together, these approach open up to a greater reflexivity and preparedness to face uncertain condition and build a more resilient global society.</p>

				<p>Predicting where and when people travel is a difficult task that could help reduce the impact of transportation on climate change and increase sustainability across urban systems. Over the past few years, computational Social Science and transportation engineering have developed many tools to simulate large-scale travel. These simulations serve to plan transportation network and orient urban development. To this end, researchers increasingly rely on data they derive from social media applications and mobile phone usage. Yet, if we want urban models of where, when and how people choose to travel, we need representative sample of the entire population and the complete location of each individual.</p>

As any technology, AI offers much potential and poses certain risks, which planners and city officials must consider. Face detection, movement tracking, image analysis are examples of applied machine and deep learning technology that can both improve urban sustainability and be a threat to personal information. AI &amp; Cities was a track at the Applied Machine Learning Days, which mission was to showcase the variety of approach and critics on the development and application of AI in urban contexts.
