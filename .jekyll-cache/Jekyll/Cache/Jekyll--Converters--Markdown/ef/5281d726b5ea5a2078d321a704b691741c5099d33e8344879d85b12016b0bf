<p>I am a urban designer, policy-maker and coder.</p>

<p>My work centers on spatial justice and sustainability in and outside cities, computational urban design approaches to resilience and the integration of citizens’ participation in design and legistlation. I focus on the relationship between aspirations, affordances and capabilities in the production of space, interrogate design contribution to the production of values, and develop methodologies and interventions that address injustice, carelessness, inequity and polarization among individuals, groups, communities, regions and countries.</p>
