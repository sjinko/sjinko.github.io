<h2 id="designing-with-citizens-aspirations-affordances--capabilities">Designing with Citizens’ Aspirations, Affordances &amp; Capabilities</h2>
<p>I am a urban designer, policy-maker, coder, and co-founder of Paris-based urban planning cooperative Chôros.</p>

<p>At the intersection of research and practice, my work centers on spatial justice and sustainability in and outside cities, computational urban design approaches to resilience and the integration of citizens’ participation in design and legistlation. My engagements address the relationship between aspirations, affordances and capabilities in the production of space and interrogate design contribution to the production of values. In this framework, I develop methodologies and interventions that address injustice, carelessness, inequity and polarization among individuals, groups, communities, regions and countries.</p>

<p>Urban space results from a collective-making process that takes place at every scale, from the body to the world. Still, many designers and policy-makers operate with segmented, disembodied and functionalistic imperatives, ignoring the diversity of aspirations, affordances and capabilities provided by citizens. In 2016, I co-founded Chôros to help communities, officials and businesses to take on complex social, political and ecological challenges. Together, we work on improving structural and infrastructural spatial planning responses to foster justice and sustainability in built and social environements. My personal background directly channels my understanding of contentious social contexts and power my motivation to create good living for all citizens. Having successfully collaborated or led dozens of high-quality citizen-centric design projects, I was nationally recognized by Swiss media in 2016 for my work on the effect of urbanization on communities polarization and then again in 2017 with a national award award from the Swiss Cartographic Society.</p>

<p>Chôros’ current projects include a redefinition the EU Common Policy on Agriculture with the <em>French National Commission for Public Debate</em>, the design of planning and constitutional guidelines to reduce green gas emissions with the <em>French Council for Economic, Social and Environmental Planning</em>, the planification of secondary schools location in metropolitan France with the <em>Ministry of Education</em>, and the redesign of logistic and service infrastructure of the <em>French National Postal Service</em>. Previously, I have also worked on planning the development of Canton of Geneva and its transnational metropolitan area, made design proposals to improve the quality and accessibility of public spaces in Lausanne, and created a nation-wide design and legal strategy to make Canadian waterways more socially, economically and ecologically sustainable.</p>
