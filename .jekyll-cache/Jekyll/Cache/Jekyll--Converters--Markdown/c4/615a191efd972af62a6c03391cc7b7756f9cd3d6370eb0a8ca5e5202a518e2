I"œ<p>While the anti-COVID-19 measures have put a stain on many events, they also fostered impromptu visits from distinguished guests. Virtually at least.</p>

<p>Today, we welcomed <a href="https://www.arch.columbia.edu/faculty/329-david-grahame-shane">David Grahame Shane</a>, professor at Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation of the Columbia University in the City New York.</p>

<p>From his home, Professor Grahame Shane provided insightful feedback to the labâ€™s PhD researchers about their works. The meeting was the occasion to reconnect with an old friend of the lab and remind us of his latest visit few years ago, in propria persona.</p>
