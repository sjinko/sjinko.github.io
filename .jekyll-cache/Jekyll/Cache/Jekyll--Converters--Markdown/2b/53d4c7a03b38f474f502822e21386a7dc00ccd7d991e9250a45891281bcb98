<h2 id="designing-with-citizens-aspirations-affordances--capabilities">Designing with Citizensâ€™ Aspirations, Affordances &amp; Capabilities</h2>
<p>I am a urban designer, policy-maker, coder, and co-founder of Paris-based urban planning cooperative ChÃ´ros.</p>

<p>At the intersection of research and practice, my work centers on spatial justice and sustainability in and outside cities, computational urban design approaches to resilience and the integration of citizensâ€™ participation in design and legistlation. My engagements address the relationship between aspirations, affordances and capabilities in the production of space and interrogate design contribution to the production of values. In this framework, I develop methodologies and interventions that address injustice, carelessness, inequity and polarization among individuals, groups, communities, regions and countries.</p>

<p>Urban space results from a collective-making process that takes place at every scale, from the body to the world. Still, many designers and policy-makers operate with segmented, disembodied and functionalistic imperatives, ignoring the diversity of aspirations, affordances and capabilities provided by citizens. In 2016, I co-founded ChÃ´ros to help communities, officials and businesses to take on complex social, political and ecological challenges. Together, we work on improving structural and infrastructural responses to spatial planning for more just and more sustainable built and social environements. My personal background directly channels my understanding of contentious social contexts and power my motivation to create good living for all citizens.</p>
